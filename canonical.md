> 2 righe di storia (educazione + impieghi), qualche riga di contenuto (dimostrare cosa sai fare), conclusione su perchè sei un buon fit per questa posizione.

Graduated in Foreign Languages for International Management, with several study and work experiences abroad, I have been working for the past three years at the International Office of Università Cattolica, Milan, where I manage study abroad programs entirely from budgeting, to promotion to students' enrolment and pre-departure orientation.

During the past three years I found myself working well both in team and independently, and performing well under pressure to meet deadlines and goals. I have increased students' enrolment in our programs and strongly supported the use of technology and social media to be more effective in our communicative efforts.

Not only abroad but also in my current position, I have developed flexibility and adaptability to multicultural contexts, showing also a very sociable yet professional attitude.
I have acquired good organisational skills and I am a fast learner when approaching fields I am not familiar with.
Therefore, I am applying for this position because I believe I can be a very good fit for such a role.
Moreover, I would like to move to the corporate sector to face new challenges, and I believe Unilever would be a great company to continue my path of professional growth.

Should my profile be of any interest for you, please do not hesitate to contact me.
