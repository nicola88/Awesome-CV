%\lettersection{Why Me?}

I graduated in Computer Science six years ago and I always loved working with data.

I spent the last six years building back-end software systems for accounting firms, startups and established companies, using different technology stacks and software development methodologies, working with multidisciplinary and remote teams and learning how to organize my work to satisfy software requirements and deadlines and deliver a robust, reliable and well-documented product for clients and customers.

In 2014 I joined a startup willing to rebuild from scratch their flagship product to meet growing demands in term of features and performance. An year later we delivered a product based on a different technology stack, redesigned public and internal APIs and a complete rewrite of all semantic text analysis algorithms to run on a distributed computing environment, a project I was the lead developer and maintainer.

In 2017 a small remote team looking for a back-end developer asked me to review and test their PHP web application four months ahead of public release. In that time frame we successfully completed all tests, fixed several critical issues and carried out significant updates improving performance, security and maintainability.

In 2018 I was assigned the task of designing and building a Python web application to provide an NLU platform for a suite of chatbot applications dealing with personal and sensitive data. At the end of last year the application was made available in production for several clients and currently handles hundred of thousands conversations each day.

Currently, I am working on several projects based on Python, Scala and Apache Kafka. 

Let me know if you are interested in my profile and want to discuss it further.
